# BERT Question Answering Agent

This project implements a BERT-based Question Answering (QA) system that supports dynamic user input and automated output generation.

## 🚀 Features
- Uses pre-trained BERT model for question answering
- Accepts dynamic user input (no hardcoded questions)
- Automatically generates answers based on given context
- Agent-friendly structure for easy integration
- Clean and modular Python implementation

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User provides a question as input
2. Context text is passed to the BERT QA model
3. The model processes the input and extracts the most relevant answer
4. The answer is returned automatically

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- BERT (bert-base-uncased)
- PyTorch

## 📦 Use Cases
- AI chat agents
- Question-answering systems
- NLP learning and experimentation
- Backend integration for intelligent assistants

## 📌 Note
This repository focuses on converting inbuilt BERT input/output logic into a dynamic, prompt-driven workflow suitable for automation and agent usage.
